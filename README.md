I'm Mariano, a Google Developer Expert and Full-Stack dev based in Costa Rica. For more than 8 years I've been dealing with web technologies, one of my passions is Javascript and any tool/framework that uses it. I love work with tech community giving talks, workshops.


#### Fun Facts

- I love food, Why? Food brings people together, generate relationships, and it's delicious!
- I'm living at beach (best decision I've ever taken)
- My taste changes every sometime in any area, food, drinks, colors (e.g last year most of my T-Shirts were dark blue, this year are white)
